**Understanding API Keys vs Authorization Tokens in Google Cloud APIs**

---

### üîë What Are API Keys?

- API keys are used to **identify your application** when accessing Google APIs.
- They're tied to a **Google Cloud Project**.
- Typically used for simple and public APIs like Google Maps.
- Stored securely in environment files (`.env`).

**Example**:

```http
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=London&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Key Points**:

- Identify the app or project.
- Easy to use and integrate.
- Do not identify users.
- Limited in terms of access control.

### üîê What Are Authorization Tokens?

- Tokens are used to **authenticate users or service accounts**.
- Required when accessing **private** or **user-specific** Google services (like Google Drive, Gmail, or Cloud Storage).
- Typically use **OAuth 2.0** or **Service Accounts**.

**Common Use Cases**:

- Accessing Google Cloud Storage buckets securely.
- Running backend servers with permissions to modify Google Cloud resources.
- Accessing user data (Google Calendar, Gmail) with user consent.

**Example (Bearer Token Usage)**:

```http
GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files
Authorization: Bearer ya29.A0ARrdaM...
```

**Key Points**:

- Identify users or backend services.
- Include permissions and scopes.
- Tokens expire and can be revoked.
- Required for secure cloud access.

### ‚úÖ When to Use What?

| Situation                                        | Use API Key | Use Auth Token |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Google Maps, YouTube Data (basic usage)          | ‚úÖ Yes       | ‚ùå No           |
| Google Drive, Calendar, Gmail (user-specific)    | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| Accessing GCS, Compute Engine, BigQuery (secure) | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| Backend server controlling cloud infra           | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Yes          |

### üîé Analogy

- **API Key**: A name badge saying "Hi, I'm this app!"
- **Auth Token**: A secure pass with roles and permissions saying "I have access to this room!"

### üìÜ Best Practices

- Never expose your API keys or tokens in frontend code.
- Use `.env` files and server-side code to handle secrets.
- Restrict API keys by IP, domain, or API service.
- Use **OAuth** when accessing user data.
- Use **Service Accounts** for backend-to-Google Cloud communication.
